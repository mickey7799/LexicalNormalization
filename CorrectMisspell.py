# 3. Normalised Levenshtein Distance
# Levenshtein distance can be normalized,
# so that the results of several distance measures can be meaningfully compared.
# Two strategies are available for Levenshtein:
# either the length of the shortest alignment between the sequences is taken as factor,
# or the length of the longer one. Example uses:
